# python_challenge
This assignment was to understand python more by importing csv's of PyBank and PyPoll. A path was set for both csv's and the script was written to analyze the inoformaton that was given. The given results gave the financial analysis of PyBank as seen in the export file, PyBank.txt and it also gave candidate analysis which shows the percentage and total votes of each candidate and the winner. These results were exported to text file called Pypoll.text and Candidate_list. There was an issue in showing all three candidaates results in the export Candidiate_list file however, it did come out in the jupyter notebook.
